## Authors : Folino Filippo Andrea, Sullazzo Teodoro (@teo-sl)

This repository contains the source code of a project done for the university course "Big Data Models and Techniques". The work is divided into two components:

  1.  a dashboard for viewing and querying a large set of data relating to flights in the USA in the year 2013;
  2.  notebooks that perform some Machine Learning tasks (classification and regression) on the same data.
  
  
 The technologies used for the projects are
  
  1. Pyspark, for processing large amount of data;
  2. Dash coupled with Plotly, for data visualization;
  3. MLlib for machine learning tasks;
 
 
The dashboard is executable through the app.py.
